\subsection{Performance Analysis}
%Our performance analysis is primarily performed using the BookSim 2.0 network simulator \cite{booksim}.
To accurately model Plasticine's timing characteristics, we implemented a wrapper for BookSim that simulates the timing properties of various operations \cite{booksim}.
This is automatically generated by the Spatial compiler backend, ensuring that they accurately represent their operations.
Operations are modeled based on the counts of inputs and outputs that they consume and produce, and are also considered to have fixed buffer sizes (4 elements).
Unfortunately, our simulation runs currently all deadlock.
We attempted to resolve this problem, and identified another potential deadlock
mitigation. However, after applying our new technique, we were still unable to
resolve the problem prior to the deadline. Therefore, we are unable to present simulated performance results. Instead, we evaluate the performance of a variety of routing algorithms on a set of benchmark applications by comparing their achieved scores on the heuristics in Table ~\ref{heuristics}.
